#### **The way forward is inward**

#### A lot of us struggle to identify the root cause of our problems. The symptoms are clear: a stressed mind and a tense body. Ignoring, avoiding or suppressing oneself may be effective in the short term, but will ultimately lead to an unhappy mind. Together, we will investigate and make sense of the challenges in your life. The good news is that you already have the answers within you. I only need to help you see them too. I will use a combination of insight- and experience-based techniques to achieve this. Take some time to sit with yourself and let your inner journey begin.
