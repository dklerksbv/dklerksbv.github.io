###### Current Offer
consists of ACT coaching (individual) and mindfulness training (individual, group, or digital audio recordings). Sessions can be purchased individually or in packages and can be delivered via video call or face-to-face. Money should never be an obstacle for personal development. Thatâ€™s why I work with three pricing options: Option 1 is the standard rate, Option 2 is for people with low income/purchasing power, and Option 3 is for those who would like to contribute so that people with low income/purchasing power can still participate. Is the lowest price still not affordable for you? Then please contact me to discuss the possibility of free sessions. When you make a purchase with me, you automatically accept the terms and conditions so please read them in advance. 
###### Email, text, or call me before making a purchase so that I can check my availability and guarantee that I can provide the service or product (See contactpage).
