I am a psychologist, coach and minfulness trainer; a musican, meditator and traveler; a loving partner and bonus dad of a cat; I'm founder of Sitting with Yourself and... Well, these are just thoughts, and I try not to take them too seriously. Perhaps more relevant to you is my experience in coaching.

Since 2016, I have been helping people overcome addiction problems in the GGZ (specialized medical care in Amsterdam). You will meet many different people there, each with a unique set of problems. However, they all seem to share one common issue: the inability to effectively cope with themselves. Some work too much, others can't seem to quit using social media, and still others struggle with difficult social relationships. I believe that everyone is capable to learn how to be happy with themselves. My vision of mental health is optimistic, holistic, and transdiagnostic.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#bgfn1" id="bgfnref1">[1]</a></sup>

I am trained in the scientific tradition through my university studies in clinical psychology (MSc), supplemented by additional education (HBO+ mindfulness trainer and WO cognitive behavioral therapy: foundation accredited, not registered), and extensive work experience within the TOP GGZ institution where I currently work. The investigation of mental health problems using the empirical cycle and attempting to resolve them through [evidence-based treatment](https://dklerksbv.github.io/mindfulness.html?lang=nl#mindfulness) is therefore familiar to me. 

Through my own search for happiness, I have walked various paths. I have experimented with different types of love relationships (poly and kink) and have experienced my partners as mirrors for self-development. To this day,  I continue to value the loving and educative interactions I have with them. In addition, I have incorporated daily meditation into my routine and have traveled extensively. I have participated in various retreats in the Netherlands, Belgium, Malaysia, Thailand, India, and Tibet <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#bgfn2" id="bgfnref2">[2]</a></sup>. Here I encountered fascinating philosophies and spiritual traditions. While some of what I encountered seemed airy or even nonsensical, the rest unexpectedly aligned with our scientific perspective. I have combined this with theory from my background in psychology and developed a simple and effective method for insight and hapiness. I have applied this method to myself and discovered a path out of my struggles. I am confident that this method can also assist you with your inquiry. If a critical voice arises within you, that is wonderful. See for yourself whether the things I suggest make sense. Personal experience and understanding play crucial roles in determining what works best for anyone of us. So please, take the time to test, reflect, and tailor any approach to fit your unique needs and circumstances.

        Transdiagnostic means that I focus on patterns underlying diagnoses and symptoms. I prefer not to make diagnoses because sometimes they bring more problems than solutions.
