#### Why Mindfulness?

The key to enjoying the extraordinary benefits of mindfulness meditation is the practice of everyday mindfulness – that is, showing up for your life and enjoying the moment.

In this introductory-series of Sitting with Yourself, I explain in 5 blogs what the method of Sitting with Yourself entails and how it can provide more self-awareness and satisfaction in a simple yet effective way.
We start at the beginning. What is mindfulness? The quote captures it perfectly: Mindfulness is nothing more than showing up on the stage of our lives, in other words: being present. And that's it. Nothing more, nothing less. Common synonyms include noticing, perceiving, and experiencing. So far, simple, right? One of the promised effects already reveals itself: knowing the order of the day. This creates a moment of choice, allowing you to optimize your happiness: Change what you can change, accept what you cannot change, and recognize the difference between the two <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#bggn1" id="bggnref1">[1]</a></sup>.
During all the moments when you are not mindful, the autopilot takes over. Unfortunately, it doesn't do so well when it comes to the optimization of our happiness. The autopilot's task is to evaluate all our experiences as 'good', 'bad', or 'neutral'. The result is automatic action: pleasant experiences are sought, unpleasant experiences are avoided, and neutral experiences are ignored. In this way, the autopilot increases our chances of survival. It is indispensable in life-threatening situations, but during many other moments of our lives, it interprets the situation completely wrong: situations that could increase our happiness are avoided because they come with unpleasant experiences (e.g., exercising, eating healthy, standing up for yourself, stepping out of your comfort zone, etc.), and situations that decrease our happiness are sought because they come with pleasant experiences (e.g., excessive alcohol, drugs, netflix, reddit, social media, work, etc.). Equally important, neutral experiences are ignored, leading to a distorted view of reality. The fuel for the autopilot is the underlying fears. The more fearful you are, the stronger your survival system, and the more you will be led by the autopilot. Mindfulness makes us aware of this pattern and allows us to get ahead of the autopilot.
But you cannot force mindfulness, no matter how much you want to. The sooner you accept this, the less frustration you will experience during your meditations. Remember this well, as it is the reason why most beginners (and often experienced meditators) encounter difficulties. What you can do is create the right situation in which mindfulness can arise. This introductory-series is intended to support you with this. The idea is: the easier and more effective your meditations are, the more often you will sit with yourself, and the more rewarding the effect will be on the rest of your life. In the next blog, I will explain how you can meditate and introduce three things you need to know before you start.
