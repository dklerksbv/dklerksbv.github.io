#### Why meditation?

Meditation is commonly defined in the West as the practice of mindfulness <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#bffn1" id="bffnref1">[1]</a></sup>. The method of Sitting with Yourself also falls into this category. We can direct our meditation towards all the experiences we can be conscious of (seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling, tasting, and/or thinking; <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#bffn2" id="bffnref2">[2]</a></sup>). Take a look at model A in the image accompanying this blog <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#bffn3" id="bffnref3">[3]</a></sup>. Here, you can see the three traditional steps of meditation. I will explain the model using possibly the most well-known form of meditation in the West, the breathing exercise: 

I. Mindfulness of focal point: You initially direct your attention to the sensation of breathing, for example, at the nose, abdomen, or chest.

II. Distraction: Subsequently, there will be a moment when your mind has drifted away from the breath, and your attention is elsewhere (the autopilot mentioned in the previous blog has taken over again).

III. Intervention: Finally, you actively bring your attention back to the sensation of breathing at the nose, abdomen, or chest. After this intervention, there is a renewed state of mindfulness, placing you back at the beginning of the cycle.

The same approach can be applied in activities like a body scan, where the focal point is a specific part of your body (such as the left big toe).

If you're just starting with meditation, you may notice that you can only maintain mindfulness of the focal point for a few seconds before the autopilot takes over again. If your brain works like mine, you might eventually feel quite frustrated, bored, or desperate. This is quite a normal reaction of the brain and happens to everyone. The downside is that many people give up: 'Mindfulness isn't for me', 'This is too airy-fairy', 'What am I doing?', 'Forget it!'. Fortunately, I have a simple step-by-step plan for you that will help you create a situation more akin to model B of the image.
In the upcoming blogs, I will tell you more about this and I will introduce 3 things you need to know before you start meditating. If I had known all of this at the beginning of my exploration, it would have saved me a lot of unnecessary frustration, and I hope it will make your life just a bit easier too.

Here are the 3 things summarized:
1. Basic Knowledge: Mindfulness and meditation explained through the lens of a psychologist (explained mainly in blogs 1 and 2).
2. Grounding: The Window of Mindfulness and the Mindfulness Cheatsheet (explained in blogs 3 and 4).
3. Direct Approach: Letting go of control and non-doing (explained in blog 5).

By learning the basics and using grounding techniques, you will find that your meditations become much easier and more effective (with every type of meditation). Additionally, you can use both for general emotion regulation. The explanation of the Direct Approach is essential if you want to achieve profound insight and clear awareness, not only in meditation, but perhaps even more importantly in all other moments of your life. Make no mistake: All of the challenges that you will face in your meditations will also be faced in one way or another in your daily life. (whether you are aware of it or not). And all the skills and insights you gain through meditation can be groundbreaking for the areas of your life that truly matter to you. Meditation is the art of learning to deal with yourself and the world. And this is one of the reasons why meditation can be such a powerful pattern-breaker.

         However, there are also other ways of meditating that are often used in religious settings and, in practice, have less to do with mindfulness (think of chanting, repeating mantras, worshipping, etc.).  </sup><a href="#bffnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

        Many eastern traditions mention the '6 sense doors.' In this metaphor, sensory experiences enter consciousness through these 'doors': Seeing through the eyes, hearing through the ears, smelling through the nose, tasting through the mouth, feeling through the body, and thinking through... Well, when it comes to thinking, it gets interesting. The 6th door is thinking in the broadest sense of the word: all possible mental experiences such as thoughts, visualizations, interpretations, judgments, memories, plans, fantasies, dreams, etc. They call it a sense because, unlike western psychology, eastern traditions believe that thinking does not arise from an independent individual actively influencing what happens in consciousness, but rather through conditioning (again the autopilot, as mentioned earlier) </sup><a href="#bffnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>
