#### The Mindfulness Cheatsheet

Mindfulness is a desired state of being that we ideally want to be in throughout the day. However, it is a given that the automatic pilot and the state of mindfulness will constantly alternate. One moment you are clear and aware, and the next moment, you may find yourself completely drifted away. This happens to everyone, regardless of the amount of meditation experience. Therefore, striving for endless mindfulness (often referred to as 'enlightenment' in the literature) can backfire. Conversely, understanding how mindfulness works and how to optimize it can be beneficial. Unlike beginners, experienced meditators (perhaps intuitively) know when thoughts begin to wander and what techniques can work to clear the mind. At the same time, too much emphasis on technique can make meditations rigid and cold. It's about finding the balance between effort (using techniques for more control) and relaxation (letting go of control). To better understand this, I have created the Mindfulness Cheatsheet.

The Mindfulness Cheatsheet is a guide that can help you better understand which techniques to use when. However, every person is different. Therefore, let your own experience, intuition, and insight weigh more heavily than the information from this blog. In other words, when in doubt, do what feels right, even if it contradicts my recommendations.

In the previous blog, I talked about the Window of Mindfulness and explained this model extensively. Building on that theory, let's now look at the image accompanying this blog. Here you can see similar categories of red, blue and orange, corresponding to (subtle) overstimulation, (subtle) understimulation and the Window of Mindfulness. If your mind is more overstimulated, choose a relaxation-focused technique (described in the red part of the Cheatsheet). If your mind is more understimulated, choose an activation-focused technique (described in the blue section). Once you have managed to ground the mind to some extent (recognizable by a state of somewhat stable mindfulness and little distraction), choose a 'technique' described in the orange section of the cheatsheet. 

You will notice that some techniques are easy to apply, while others may need additional explanation or practice. In general, try to match external stimuli with your internal state of stimulation: if you are more understimulated, start with a low-stimulus meditation and gradually increase stimuli. If you are more overstimulated, start with a high-stimulus meditation and gradually decrease stimuli.
Everything I have explained so far can be summarised in the following 2-step plan:
1. Ask yourself: am I currently more overstimulated, understimulated, or somewhere in between/mindful?
2. Apply an appropriate technique as an intervention (see also Model B, blog 2).

The more you practice, the easier these steps will become for you. At some point, you may even notice that your system will automatically ground itself when the situation requires it, whether you are meditating or not. At that moment, the Mindfulness Cheatsheet becomes unnecessary, and your meditations become as simple as riding a car. It takes time, but the reward is incredibly significant: the ability to deal with life's challenges flexibly and consciously.
In the next and final blog of this introduction-series, I will explain why letting go of control is the way to go when you are within the Window of Mindfulness. I will tell you exactly how to do that and what results you can expect.


## Appendix: List of Movement Exercises
Muscle tension. During and after, feel the effect of tension: 
- Pulling shoulders up to the neck
- Making fists
- Curling toes
- Standing on tiptoes


Walking:
- Slow-motion: If you are overstimulated, start with fast walking and gradually slow down your pace until you are walking in slow-motion.
- Fast walking: If you are understimulated, start with slow-motion walking and gradually speed up your pace until you are walking somewhat quickly.


Breathing and movement:
- Eyes move in sync with the breath (In: eyes up & out: eyes down, or In: eyes open & out: eyes closed)
- Belly moves in sync with the breath (In: push belly out & out: pull belly in)
- Feet move in sync with the breath (In: on tiptoes & out: on feet)
- Hands move in sync with the breath (In: Stretch hands upwards & out: relax hands along the body)

In case of high dysregulation: Go to a place where you feel safe (e.g., bedroom)
- 5 things. Look around with your eyes open and find 5 things in the room that have the same color. Once you've found them, listen carefully and try to distinguish 3 different sounds from each other. What do you think is the source of the sound? If that feels okay for you, make contact with your body. Try to feel 1 neutral/pleasant physical sensation in your body (ignore the negative feelings until you are completely grounded).
- Index finger. Use the index finger of one hand to move it along the 5 fingers of the other hand. Follow the outline of the hand from thumb to pinky and back. Repeat the cycle as needed. Each time you start at the bottom of a finger, move to the top of the finger, and then go back down. Move your index finger in synch with the breath (In: index finger up towards the top, out: index finger down towards the bottom). Concentrate on the pace of breathing, the feeling of your index finger along the other fingers, as well as seeing the movements. Adjust the speed of your index finger (breathing speed) based on your internal state of stimulation.
- Temperature check. Take a shower. When you are under the shower stream, try to feel how the temperature of the shower matches your bodily needs. Does your body want it warmer or colder? Adjust the shower temperature as slowly as you can (in slow-motion) in the direction your body wants. Try to follow every change in temperature with your attention. If you have found the perfect temperature but are not yet well-grounded, you can still move back and forth with minimal temperature differences. Keep feeling what water temperature your body would like.

If all else fails:
- Stop mindfulness/meditation, seek distraction, write down your thoughts, or engage in a conversation.
